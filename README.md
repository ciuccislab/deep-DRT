# Introduction
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a widely used characterization method in electrochemistry to gain
physical and chemical insights. Despite its power, the interpretation of EIS data is challenging. Physical models are usually problem-specific and equivalent circuits are not unique.
The distribution of relaxation times (DRT) approach overcomes these issues by assuming that electrochemical processes are relaxations characterized by their timescales [1]. However, the DRT deconvolution from experimental data is challenging because it is an ill-posed inverse problem and very sensitive to experimental errors [2,3]. To solve this issue many approaches have been used [2-5].

Moreover, while EIS spectra are collected at specific experimental conditions, they are typically deconvolved only relative to frequency. The deep-DRT model relaxes this limitation and considers EIS spectra to be a multidimensional function of the frequency and “experimental state” described by a vector of state variables (e.g., temperature and oxygen partial pressure).
Generalizing our previous model [6], the deep-DRT framework leverages deep neural networks to perform the DRT deconvolution.  Performing simulations with both articial and real experiments confirmed the capability of the deep-DRT model to perform both regression and prediction at untested conditions..

# Tutorials
1. **Ex1_ZARC.ipynb**: this notebook shows that the deep-DRT can catch the linear dependency of the charge transfer resistance on the scalar state variable $\psi$. The frequency range is from $10^{-4}$ Hz to $10^{4}$ Hz with 10 points per decade (ppd).
2. **Ex2_double_ZARC.ipynb** : this notebook shows that the deep-DRT can catch the linear dependency of the charge transfer resistance and the exponential dependence of the timescale constant on the scalar state variable $\psi$. The frequency range is from $10^{-4}$ Hz to $10^{4}$ Hz with 10 points per decade (ppd).
3. **Ex3_PWC.ipynb** : this notebook shows that the deep-DRT can catch the linear dependency of the charge transfer resistance on the scalar state variable $\psi$ in case the DRT shows discontinuities. The frequency range is from $10^{-4}$ Hz to $10^{4}$ Hz with 10 points per decade (ppd).
4. **Ex4_BLF_D5.ipynb** : this notebook shows an example with experimental data. The dataset is read from a folder containing EIS spectra saved in csv files. The DRT is deconvolved from 3D EIS data as functions of the temperature and partial pressure of oxygen.
